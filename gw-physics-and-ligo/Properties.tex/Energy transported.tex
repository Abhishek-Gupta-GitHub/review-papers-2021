\subsection{Energy transported by gravitational wave}

Since gravitational wave travels in the speed of light, the energy is also transported at that speed. And since Energy flux is equal to the product of Energy and speed, The average energy flux `$E$' is given by

\begin{equation}
    E = \frac{c^{3}}{16\pi G} \left \langle (h_{+})^{2} + (h_{\times})^{2} \right \rangle 
\end{equation}

So we see the energy flux is very huge because of the term $\frac{c^{3}}{16 \pi G}$ which is in the order of $10^{33}$ Joules sec/ metre$^2$  and it also depends on the average of the square of the plus and cross polarized amplitudes `$h_{+}$' and `$h_{\times}$'. \\

Due to such huge energy it carries the wave can travel unimpeded forever through space and no obstacle can damp gravitational wave because the space in which the obstacle lies itself is the medium of the wave. But the Doppler effect and decrease in amplitude due to radiation of energy causes the wave to die out after the wave travels a very long distance according to the relation $A \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$\:. So the power or intensity of gravitational wave decreases as it moves through space according to this inverse square law.
